## Tasks 

### Task 1 - Modelling 

- Designing and assigning coordinate frames for the robot
- Writing graphical simulations using Matlab 
- Determine the Inverse Kinematics of the robot 
- Demostrating the inverse kinematics with the simulation 
  - Tracing a square in each cartesian plane with end effector 
  - Create a video demonstrating the tracing action 

### Task 2 - Pick and Place

Given the cube positions and orientations, perform:
- Translation 
- Re-orientation 
- Re-orientating and stacking several cubes on to

### Task 3 - Trajectory Following 

Given a specified trajectory, trace a trajectory with a pen consisting of *straight lines* and *curves of constant radius* 
- Smoothness and accuracy are important 
- Designing 3D parts to hold the pen securely 

### Task 4 - Self-selected Task 

Create a application for robotic manipulation using a **4 DOF + 1 DOF gripper**.

Guidelines:
- No liquids 
- No electrical objects
